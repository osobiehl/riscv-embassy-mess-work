/// Unsafely unborrow an owned singleton out of a `&mut`.
///
/// It is intended to be implemented for owned peripheral singletons, such as `USART3` or `AnyPin`.
/// Unborrowing an owned `T` yields the same `T`. Unborrowing a `&mut T` yields a copy of the T.
///
/// This allows writing HAL drivers that either own or borrow their peripherals, but that don't have
/// to store pointers in the borrowed case.
///
/// Safety: this trait can be used to copy non-Copy types. Implementors must not cause
/// immediate UB when copied, and must not cause UB when copies are later used, provided they
/// are only used according the [`Self::unborrow`] safety contract.
