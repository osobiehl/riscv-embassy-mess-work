//! Time driver interface
//!
//! This module defines the interface a driver needs to implement to power the `embassy::time` module.
//!
//! # Implementing a driver
//!
//! - Define a struct `MyDriver`
//! - Implement [`Driver`] for it
//! - Register it as the global driver with [`time_driver_impl`].
//! - Enable the Cargo features `embassy/time` and one of `embassy/time-tick-*` corresponding to the
//!   tick rate of your driver.
//!
//! If you wish to make the tick rate configurable by the end user, you should do so by exposing your own
//! Cargo features and having each enable the corresponding `embassy/time-tick-*`.
//!
//! # Linkage details
//!
//! Instead of the usual "trait + generic params" approach, calls from embassy to the driver are done via `extern` functions.
//!
//! `embassy` internally defines the driver functions as `extern "Rust" { fn _embassy_time_now() -> u64; }` and calls them.
//! The driver crate defines the functions as `#[no_mangle] fn _embassy_time_now() -> u64`. The linker will resolve the
//! calls from the `embassy` crate to call into the driver crate.
//!
//! If there is none or multiple drivers in the crate tree, linking will fail.
//!
//! This method has a few key advantages for something as foundational as timekeeping:
//!
//! - The time driver is available everywhere easily, without having to thread the implementation
//!   through generic parameters. This is especially helpful for libraries.
//! - It means comparing `Instant`s will always make sense: if there were multiple drivers
//!   active, one could compare an `Instant` from driver A to an `Instant` from driver B, which
//!   would yield incorrect results.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use embassy::time::driver::{Driver, AlarmHandle};
//!
//! struct MyDriver{}; // not public!
//! embassy::time_driver_impl!(static DRIVER: MyDriver = MyDriver{});
//!
//! impl Driver for MyDriver {
//!     fn now(&self) -> u64 {
//!         todo!()
//!     }
//!     unsafe fn allocate_alarm(&self) -> Option<AlarmHandle> {
//!         todo!()
//!     }
//!     fn set_alarm_callback(&self, alarm: AlarmHandle, callback: fn(*mut ()), ctx: *mut ()) {
//!         todo!()
//!     }
//!     fn set_alarm(&self, alarm: AlarmHandle, timestamp: u64) {
//!         todo!()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
